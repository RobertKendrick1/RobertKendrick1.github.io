<p>If your hot water heater has actually required numerous repairs over the last few years, it might be time to get it changed. A good rule of thumb for hot water heater is this: due to the fact that the lifespan of the typical water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. If the cost of a repair is over half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your hot water heater.</p>
<p>Take the example of the instant hot shower that uses the point-of-use hot water heater; these home appliances will supply warm water constantly for the duration you are utilizing the shower. They will stop to work just if there are power concerns or if the water heater is faulty. In essence, it heats up the water as needed with just the amount you need, hence eliminating the loss sustained with the use of storage tank water heaters where the water cools and is then reheated.</p>
