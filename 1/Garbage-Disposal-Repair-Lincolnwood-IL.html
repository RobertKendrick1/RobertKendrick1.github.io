<p>Discover if there are any lead pipes in the home. Residences that were built prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how helpful, is an ecological contaminant (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in homes that is not lead based). You might not want to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>You reside in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and corrode when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you do not currently have one. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
