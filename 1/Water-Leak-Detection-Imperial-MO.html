<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>There are several signs to look out for. 1) The surface of the floor in one area is warm or perhaps hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all home appliances and fixtures in your home have been switched off. 3) The hot water heater appears to be running all the time. 4) All this adds up to greater gas and water bills, in some cases really quickly.</p>
