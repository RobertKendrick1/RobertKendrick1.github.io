<h3>How To Find The Best Plumbing Services Poughkeepsie NY</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
