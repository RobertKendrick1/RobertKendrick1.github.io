<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future.
