<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the very first most obvious signs of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid major damage to your home. Even if the issue comes from with the local system, it's still wise to bring in the experts to restrict the damage to your home.</p>
<p>You'll observe that water runs to fill up the bowl Whenever you flush your toilet. However, in a properly working toilet, the water should stop running once the bowl is filled to its proper capability. If your toilet continues to run, possibilities are you have an internal leak and water is being discarded down the overflow. These leakages are extremely wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water wind up traveling through the overflow.</p>

To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may want to think about repiping your whole house when you identify a leak.</p>
