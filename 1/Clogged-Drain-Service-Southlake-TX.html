<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Southlake TX</h3>

<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as tough water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
