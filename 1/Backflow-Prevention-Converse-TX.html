A red button at the bottom of the unit journeys when the disposal gets jammed to avoid harming the motor. Initially, unplug the disposal, then press the red button to eliminate the jam.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as shown in Image 1. If additional pressure on the flapper doesn't stop the running sound, water is likely getting away through a cracked or rusted overflow tube. Because case, you need to detach the tank from the bowl and replace the whole flush valve. Considering that the overflow tube is seldom the reason for a running toilet, we won't cover that repair here.</p>

<p>The traditional hot water heater has a tank that is filled with continuously heated water. It wastes energy by holding the temperature of water that is not currently in usage. Unlike residential pools, public or community pools need to use only RP gadgets or Air Gaps on their refill lines. An RP on a public or community pool must be tested upon installation and after that each year.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
