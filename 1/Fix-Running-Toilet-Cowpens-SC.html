<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Cowpens SC</h3>
<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Model GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is among the least expensive backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage just for non-health hazard or health risk conditions. They need to be installed downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some towns do not allow the usage of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only safeguard versus back siphonage.</p>
<p>Other pipe repair techniques include our Pipe Pull strategy and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull technique interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into place. All new replacement pipes have a projected life-span of one a century and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another efficient strategy is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically eliminates the need for broken pipe removal. By inserting a solidifying lining product which coats the within the existing pipe, a brand-new pipe is created inside the broken one.</p>
