When roots ultimately do piece your drain lines, they can cause obstructions, breaks, and back-ups which might result in substantial home damage. Look out for moist, green patches in your lawn, a relentless sewage smell in or around your house, an uptick in rodent and insect activity, and slow drains, as these are all typical indications of root intrusion.</p>
