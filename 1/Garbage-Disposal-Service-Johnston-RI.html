While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
