<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Collinsville OK</h3>
<p>B&I's plumbing department includes a professional team of licensed plumbers experienced in all aspects of commercial and industrial plumbing. We have the resources and experience to take on any job, small or large. From pre-construction preparation to post-completion follow up, our plumbing department supplies quality installations at competitive rates.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, allowing air to bring back and get in the valve pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
