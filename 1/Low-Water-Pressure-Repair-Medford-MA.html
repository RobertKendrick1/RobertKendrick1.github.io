<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
