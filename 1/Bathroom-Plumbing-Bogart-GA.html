<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be tailored to your water needs. Your EcoWater Pro will test your water to identify the ideal water treatment for your home. A single tank or cabinet-style system needs less space since the softener's brine tank nests inside of the salt tank. The CareSoft Â® system was established with the very same advanced engineering as the Pro and Elite models, with resin that delivers high-performance solidity removal you can rely on for several years to come.</p>
<p>Softeners mainly get rid of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are often referred to as 'hardness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they must be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a huge red flag that something more severe is incorrect with them.</p>
