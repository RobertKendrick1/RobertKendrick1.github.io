Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
