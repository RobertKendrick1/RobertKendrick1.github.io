<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In South Pasadena CA</h3>
<p>Plumbing and piping innovation has actually improved over the last thirty years. Copper has been the favored choice to replace galvanized iron pipes (which used to be thought about really strong, however they were discovered to break under pressure and tend to corrode within a few years). Today, many quality contractors utilize PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
