<p>We supply same-day, full-service professional plumbing installation of new toilets, urinals, bidets and bidet seats. RV = The Relief Valve runs by sensing the pressure difference across the # 1 Inspect Valve. The Relief Valve must start to open before the pressure difference falls below 2.0 psi. Your plumbing contractor should complete a repiping task with some mix of the above pipes.</p>
<p>The Final Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that manages water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't installed correctly, you might experience a regularly or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>
