<p>Backflow preventers are critical for producing a safe supply of water system. No matter which design you select, all water softeners need to be properly preserved. The salt water option need to be combined and kept in the salt water tank. Routine clogging of the resin likewise needs special attention. For example, if the raw supply of water is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. Often, regular backwashing with water will resolve this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help separate the product. Similarly, bacteria and fungi also form mats in the resin that lower its effectiveness. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or occasionally cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these problems. However, read the maker's directions before including any chemicals to the unit.</p>
