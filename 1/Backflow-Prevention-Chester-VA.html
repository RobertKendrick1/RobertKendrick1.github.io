<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Chester VA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
