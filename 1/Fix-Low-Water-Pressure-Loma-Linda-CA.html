<p>Poorly installed gas lines cause gas leaks. Gas leakages are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy task. The gas lines have to be adjusted to the right levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a house, beside heating & cooling. The amount of minerals liquified in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>
<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water supply exceeds the pressure in the potable system offering the makeup water. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Possible pollutants can then go into the potable water supply. The very best way to lower accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>
<p>Call 831-393-9321 for fast and reliable hot water heater solutions. Experience real quality service when you deal with our Beachfront plumbers.
