When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system. Current guidelines limit the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines.
