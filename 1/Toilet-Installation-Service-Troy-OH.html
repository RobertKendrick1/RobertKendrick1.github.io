With a trademarked chlorine generator, our exceptional systems likewise offer an automated cleaning cycle.

Your local Culligan Guy will examine the firmness of your water, the size of your household and even your home's plumbing prior to suggesting the perfect water softening option for you and your spending plan. All plumbing and gasfitting work requires an authorization and inspection. To schedule, reschedule, cancel or inquire about an inspection, call 410-887-4638 or use Inspection Connection and follow the triggers. Please have your authorization number and three-digit inspection code all set. Inspections might be scheduled till 8 p.m. for the next day.</p>
<p>A plumbing authorization attends to 3 inspections. Additional inspections are $50.00 each. Inspections called in on work not finished, not effectively installed, or on an inaccessible home will require re-inspection. It is the authorization holder's responsibility to reschedule the inspection and make provisions for the plumbing inspector to access the home.</p>
<p>Having your plumbing repiped can save you money and time in addition to secure your health in the future. After softening a large amount of difficult water, the exchange medium ends up being coated with calcium and magnesium ions. When this occurs, the exchange medium must be charged or restored (Figure 1).
