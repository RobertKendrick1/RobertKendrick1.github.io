A normal water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a neighboring drainpipe or drywell.</p>
<p>Once the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized.

This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital locations in the assembly.
