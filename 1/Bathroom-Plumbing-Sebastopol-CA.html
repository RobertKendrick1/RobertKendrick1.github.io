Consumer Private investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a quote from personal plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of the businesses we called would offer an estimate over the phone.

For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
