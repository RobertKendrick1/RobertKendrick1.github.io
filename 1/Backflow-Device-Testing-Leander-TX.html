<p>Electric hot water heater do have a few disadvantages nevertheless that are worth mentioning. Most importantly, electrical power is not as inexpensive as gas. Some energy companies charge higher rates for electrical power during peak periods such as really early in the early morning and at night. Utilizing your heater during these peak durations can increase your power bills. On the hand, gas is inexpensive and has a set rate.

<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
