<p>Leaks from old copper and galvanized pipes in older homes is a typical event. When a pipe leaks or you experience a burst pipe, you can expect to have more of your pipes stop working in the coming months or years. Each time you have the cost of finding and repairing a leaking pipe, it can be really pricey, demanding and time-consuming. The solution to costly water leak detection and repair is efficient and economical repiping to replace your out-of-date plumbing for water entering your house.</p>
<p>New homes developed with copper pipes are specifically susceptible to corrosive water conditions due to the fact that the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to end up being covered inside. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a duration of 3 to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new houses are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
