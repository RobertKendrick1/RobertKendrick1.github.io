In situ corrosion examination on the impact of softened and hard water to domestic copper and galvanized steel drinking water systems." METALogic. Before you begin the inconveniences of conventional pipe replacement, consider pipe lining. Repair damage from breaks, rust, and more, without having to replace the entire pipe. Discover why pipe lining is the proven, affordable method of restoring your damaged sewer and waste lines.</p>

<p>Many homes or structures that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system.
