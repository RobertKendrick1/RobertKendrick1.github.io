<p>Electric water heaters do have a few drawbacks however that deserve explaining. Primarily, electrical energy is not as cheap as gas. Some utility companies charge higher rates for electricity throughout peak durations such as very early in the early morning and at night. Utilizing your heater throughout these peak durations can increase your power costs. On the hand, gas is cheap and has a fixed rate. Another disadvantage of an electrical hot water heater is that they can be expensive to install, specifically when it pertains to whole-house tankless systems.</p>
<p>Take the example of the immediate hot shower that utilizes the point-of-use water heaters; these appliances will supply hot water continually for the period you are utilizing the shower. They will stop to work only if there are power problems or if the hot water heater is faulty. In essence, it heats up the water on demand with just the quantity you need, hence eliminating the loss incurred with using tank hot water heater where the water cools and is then reheated.</p>
