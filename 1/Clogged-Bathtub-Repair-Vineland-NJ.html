That odor might be originating from your sewer system, which needs repair work immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your house, launches sewer gas, and controls air pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually stopped working, it will often need to be changed instead of repaired.

Oftentimes, removal will only add an extra $25 to $50 to the overall expenses, but in many cases the costs might be higher if extra pipes must also be changed.</p>
