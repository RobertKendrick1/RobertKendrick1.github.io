<p>The toilet takes a really very long time to flush. Here's how it works: During normal operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves-- referred to as the zone of reduced pressure-- is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is designed to discharge and open water to the outside, guaranteeing backflow never happens.</p>
<p>A plumbing permit attends to three inspections. Extra inspections are $50.00 each. Inspections hired on work not completed, not properly set up, or on an unattainable home will need re-inspection. It is the authorization holder's obligation to reschedule the inspection and make provisions for the plumbing inspector to access the property.</p>
<p>A minimum of 12 inches of clear area shall be maintained above the assembly to permit servicing check valves and for operation of shut-off valves.
