<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>

<h3>How to Fix a Leaky Faucet from the Kitchen in Whiteville NC</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>When it comes to plumbing and maintenance, sewer video inspection is among the best methods to remain ahead of the game. This detailed inspection can uncover severe problems with your sewer line you might not notice till it's far too late. Utilizing this technology, you see a walk-through view of the inner-workings of your pipes, and the Seatown Electric Plumbing Heating and Air team can better decide how to remedy your problems. Our Seattle, WA group is trusted for electrical and HVAC work, so you know our plumbing services will be reliable too.</p>
<p>In addition to the garbage disposal unit, there are a number of upgrades and parts that you may need to take into account when weighing the garbage disposal installation cost. For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, decreased or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>While repiping the home is the preferred option of action with a slab leak, it is not the only choice. When Kenz plumbing initially diagnoses a leak as being under the slab, 3 choices are provided to the house owner. Salt does not have the chance to enter drinking water through softening installations. Give us a call to read more about our gas leak detection services, along with gas leak repair.</p>
