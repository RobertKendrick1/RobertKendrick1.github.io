<p>To reduce the need of gas line repair, it is essential to understand the common causes of gas leakages. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning devices occur most commonly in the winter. Because houses are not sufficiently aerated throughout the cooler months to prevent heat loss, this is.
