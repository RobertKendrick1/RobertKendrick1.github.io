<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is comprised of 6 State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, among which is also works as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Strategy Examiner for the group. There are few circumstances when plumbing inspections are necessary, however the biggest exceptions are building and home updates.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
