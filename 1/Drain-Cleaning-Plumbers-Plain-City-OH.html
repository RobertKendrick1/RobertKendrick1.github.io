<p>When choosing the correct system security there are a number of considerations we need to take a look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation should be looked at on a private basis as an unique stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems consists of the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire security system are designed to match the risk that exists in the areas they are installed in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be extremely different, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation requires to be designed and set up to meet that specific risk or need.
