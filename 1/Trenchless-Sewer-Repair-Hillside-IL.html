<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a significant clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
