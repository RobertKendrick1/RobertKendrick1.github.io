<p>Making sure plumbing equipment such as sprinkler systems and fire pumps are isolated to their own respective networks is necessary in order to protect potable water security.

Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of years, but steel ultimately suffers from corrosion and does not have the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
