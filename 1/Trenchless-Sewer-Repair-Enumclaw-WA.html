<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are lots of aspects that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that speed up rust Also, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable kind of corrosion control. Hence, thinking about all these elements, in addition to arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that a correctly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
