<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so just softened water travels through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is generally used in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
