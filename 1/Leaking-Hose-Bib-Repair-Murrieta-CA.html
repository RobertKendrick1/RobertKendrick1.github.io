<p>Polybutylene used inside your house can be found near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Warning: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when exiting the wall. Just because copper is showing does not suggest you do not have polybutylene pipes. You might have to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>

The cost is roughly the exact same for setting up a lp gas line from the tank to the house as the cost to have natural gas go to your house. Discover which type of gas your house presently has.

Sewer pipes can be infamously tough to trace, particularly on older homes, so you'll want to work with someone who will trace the problem at its origin.</p>

We will usually suggest our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending on the severity of the circumstance. Provide us a call if your kitchen drain has actually raised water levels, is making gurgling noises, smells foul, or is slow to drain.</p>
