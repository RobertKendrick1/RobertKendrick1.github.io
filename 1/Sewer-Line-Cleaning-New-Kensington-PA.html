<p>As discussed previously in the short article, carbon monoxide gas is colorless and completely odor free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide gas detector. Every house needs to have carbon monoxide gas detectors set up at the appropriate locations. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single homes to have both smoke and carbon monoxide gas detectors. They are generally sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new installations must have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
