<p>Spotty dishes? Distribution pipes shift to even smaller specific service pipes, bring water to specific homes, apartment or condo organisations, structures and shops. Depending on need, these pipes vary in size from a half inch in size to 6 inches. Water gets in the customer facility by means of a water meter that tape-records flow rates and water usage for billing functions. Specific service pipelines are normally made from type, plastic or lead K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be vital.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- typically sodium.

<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that eliminates hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most disastrous and prevalent water problems: tough water.  Hard water damaged the modern-day house. Scale builds up in your pipes, obstructing them and reducing water pressure.  Scale significantly shortens the life expectancy of appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice devices. Tough water damages warm water appliances. The higher the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and strengthen into solid deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>
