<p>Backpressure might take place when the safe and clean supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. Drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system if these connections are not correctly safeguarded.</p>
<p>A double check backflow preventer features 2 spring-loaded check assemblies to avoid back and back siphonage pressure on non-health danger (low risk) systems. Unscrew the coupling nut that links the supply line. If the toilet valve turns inside the toilet tank, hold its base with a locking pliers. Idea: Toss a towel on the floor below to capture water that will drain from the line.</p>
