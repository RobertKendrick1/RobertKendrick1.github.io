<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great person. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as promised. I will certainly use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit.
