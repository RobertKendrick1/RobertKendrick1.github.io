When chemicals are added to a fire protection system provided by a safe and clean water supply, increased protection is also needed. If you have kids, remind them to prevent holding on any visible pipelines or having fun with the outdoor gas meter. Hanging on a pipeline may cause it to come loose or break, launching gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter should be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly accessible in an emergency.</p>
