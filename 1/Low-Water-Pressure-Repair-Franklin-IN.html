<p>Supplying quality and professional repair, replacement, and installation services for your plumbing. Some jurisdictions likewise enable alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, boiler, and heater, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these small deposits are safe, however over time they build up and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can considerably restrict the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
