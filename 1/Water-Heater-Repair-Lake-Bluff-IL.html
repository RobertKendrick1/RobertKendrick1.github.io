<p>Because of an issue at the point of installation or since of maintenance, water softeners leaks are mostly caused. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated appropriately. If the bypass valve is split, it can likewise trigger the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced with time. A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal may likewise be the offender. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration procedures. A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. It is most likely split and merely needs to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
