<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Cardington OH</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
