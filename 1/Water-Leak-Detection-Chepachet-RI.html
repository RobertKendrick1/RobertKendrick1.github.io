No, it is not a frequent event, however it does occur regularly than you believe! Typically it occurs in the evening when you do not discover the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes building projects easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

At the least, it would have been a very expensive choice.</p>
