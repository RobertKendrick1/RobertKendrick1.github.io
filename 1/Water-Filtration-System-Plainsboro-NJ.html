<p>Incorrect drainage slope: Drainage pipes are designed to take waste water away from a home and deliver it to the city's sewer system. A lot of do this utilizing the power of gravity; pipes are sloped to drain water towards the street.

<p>Hard water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water passes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is typically used in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
