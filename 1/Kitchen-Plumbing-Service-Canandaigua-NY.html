<p>Understand that softened water contains trace amounts of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water includes about the same amount of salt as a slice of bread. That's not very much salt, but for those on a stringent sodium-free diet it may be excessive. If this doesn't work, you may need to replace among your toilet's elements, normally the flapper. There may also be an issue with the chain attached to the float or the flapper ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>
