<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were extremely responsive and prompt to send me a quote which was very competitive. They were extremely professional and did a remarkable job.

<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>

Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to eliminate.</p>
