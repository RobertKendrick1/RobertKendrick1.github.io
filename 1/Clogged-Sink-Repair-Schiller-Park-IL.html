Some designs might appear similar on the outside but might need different repair parts on the inside, so the repair specialist must be able to recognize the make, model and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that may have been produced.

In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially difficult with high mineral content, you might need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>
