When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual preference not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a considerable one.</p>
