Discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, but chances are you'll find among the very same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>

As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new home for a period of three to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Many brand-new houses are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
