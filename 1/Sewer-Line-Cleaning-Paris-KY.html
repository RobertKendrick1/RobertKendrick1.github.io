That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Set out the brand-new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I have actually been to many carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener. Typically, this is because the system is obsoleted or not working effectively. Whatever the factor, you can be losing out on the benefits of soft water without even understanding it.</p>
