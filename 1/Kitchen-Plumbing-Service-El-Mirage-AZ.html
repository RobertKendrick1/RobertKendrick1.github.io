Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work.

Please make certain to take the appropriate precautions if using one of these items.</p>
<p>As explained previously in the post, carbon monoxide gas is colorless and completely odor-free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide gas detector. Every house must have carbon monoxide detectors set up at the correct locations.

They are usually offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all new setups should have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
