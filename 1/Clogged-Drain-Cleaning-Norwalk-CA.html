It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be removed from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
