<p>Most residential homes have roofing seamless gutters that stream into downspout drains that direct water away from your home. When those downspouts are connected to underground drains that flow to community storm drains or street rain gutters, they in some cases become clogged with tree roots and debris.

<p>With the severity of plumbing problems being equal, you may be better off replacing your toilet if it is an older design. Older toilets frequently follow more lax policies in regards to water usage, so a more recent toilet might end up conserving you money each month. Nevertheless, some plumbing systems work best with older toilets.

<p>The Last Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that controls water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't installed properly, you may experience an often or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in squandered water.</p>
