When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. There is capacity for the contaminated water to become a health threat if allowed to return to the water supply.
