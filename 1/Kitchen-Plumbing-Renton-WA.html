<p>Most homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
