<p>The system has returned to a zero need condition (no valves open downstream). Nevertheless, particles between the # 1 Check Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the parts, is preventing the # 1 Examine from closing all the method. This enables pressure to match in between the Supply Side and the Zone of Decreased Pressure. When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring presses back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and identify the reason for the problem. The line was clearly degrading; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
