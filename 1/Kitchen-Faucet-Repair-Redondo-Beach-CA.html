<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Redondo Beach CA</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to deal with tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
