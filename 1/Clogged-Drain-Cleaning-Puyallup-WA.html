<p>Leaks are sly. Drains clog gradually. In cooking areas, greases, soaps and more build up on the walls of the pipes and cause a blockage. In bathrooms, showers, tubs and sinks become clogged with hair and soap, and toilets can end up being clogged with toilet paper. When this occurs, you need the aid of a plumber experienced in drain cleaning. While there are products on the marketplace that offer a do-it-yourself solution, these frequently offer only a short-term fix and can cause bigger problems later on.
