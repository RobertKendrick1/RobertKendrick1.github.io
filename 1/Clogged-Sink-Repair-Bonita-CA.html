<p>When choosing the correct system security there are several considerations we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation must be looked at on an individual basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of lawn sprinkler consists of the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire protection system are developed to match the danger that exists in the places they are installed in. As building types and contents of these structures can be really different, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be created and set up to satisfy that specific threat or need. An aircraft garage will need a really various fire security system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow protection requirements for these 2 examples would also vary significantly.</p>
