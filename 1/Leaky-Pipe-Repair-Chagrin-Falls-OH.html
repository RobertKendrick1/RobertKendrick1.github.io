<p>To determine which toilet valve is causing the trouble, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into television, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water discolorations and rust. However don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
