<p>Water softeners been available in all sizes and shapes and bigger absolutely does not mean much better. WaterBoss ® uses great mesh resin - smaller sized beads that really supply more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to enable maximum capability in a minimum of area. Plus, our patented Directional Circulation Screen system assists make sure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also safeguard the resin bed, so we don't need to squander space on freeboard" which is the empty area in conventional water softeners that allow a churning of resin throughout regeneration to release dirt, sediment and hardness.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer calculates the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regrowth normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
