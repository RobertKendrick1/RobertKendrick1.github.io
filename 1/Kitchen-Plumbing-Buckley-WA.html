An authorization is not needed for repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions provided modifications are not made in the existing piping or components. A typical water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, wide brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a close-by drainpipe or drywell.</p>
