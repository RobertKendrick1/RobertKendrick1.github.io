<p>To figure out which toilet valve is causing the trouble, look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to trickle into the bowl. That slow, consistent outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing entirely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts.
