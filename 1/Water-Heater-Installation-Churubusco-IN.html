<p>Backflow preventers need to only be fixed when the information collected from the field test shows the assembly has actually degraded in its efficiency below the established minimum basic. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if necessary, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This indicates the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
