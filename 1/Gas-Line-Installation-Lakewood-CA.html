When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health threat if allowed to return to the water supply.
