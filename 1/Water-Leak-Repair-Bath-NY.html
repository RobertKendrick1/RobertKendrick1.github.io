<p>Surprise water leakages are frequently difficult and have Potentially Severe Consequences. Changing your flapper might require slightly different actions than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To discover an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but opportunities are you'll find among the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
<p>Most disposals will last in between 10 and 12 years before requiring replacement.
