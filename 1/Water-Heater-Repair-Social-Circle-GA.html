<p>Whenever you flush your toilet, you'll see that water goes to fill up the bowl. However, in a properly working toilet, the water must stop running once the bowl is filled to its appropriate capacity. Chances are you have an internal leak and water is being dumped down the overflow if your toilet continues to run. These leaks are very inefficient, as more than a hundred gallons of water wind up taking a trip through the overflow.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regrowth usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
