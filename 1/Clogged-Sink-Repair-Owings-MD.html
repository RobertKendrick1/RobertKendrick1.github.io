<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and pricey plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping. Plumbing problems aren't just tough to detect, they're likewise efficient in triggering some major damage.
