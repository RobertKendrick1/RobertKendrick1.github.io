<p>Backflow valves not only safeguard you against contaminates however also your next-door neighbors who rely on the exact same water supply system. A water softener gathers firmness minerals within its conditioning tank and from time to time flushes them away to drain. Ion exchangers are often used for water softening. When an ion exchanger is looked for water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions such as salt or potassium.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
