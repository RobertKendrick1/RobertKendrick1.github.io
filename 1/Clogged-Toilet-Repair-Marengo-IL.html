The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm assurance that the special function will not fail. Depending on the water source, you may have to filter turbid water or sanitize bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening system.

Estimates suggest that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regrowth cycle. This may or may not trigger hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
<p>Water on the Floor or Discoloration of Flooring - If your feet get wet when you flush, that's not a feature ... it's an issue! It might indicate a leak under the toilet if your linoleum floor is getting dark around the toilet. Hard water is normally not damaging to one's health but can present severe plumbing problems in both commercial and residential applications.
