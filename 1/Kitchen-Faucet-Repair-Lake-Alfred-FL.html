<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so just softened water travels through to your house. When the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it should be restored (cleaned up). Salt is normally used in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
<p>With three alternatives for handling a fresh water leak under the slab, a full repipe is often the very best choice. Thinking about the area of the leak, the condition of the slab, and the development the home lies in are very important aspects when making the decision to repipe, versus rerouting or fixing. When your house is impacted by a slab leak, Kenz plumbing has the experience to guide you in the right instructions.</p>
