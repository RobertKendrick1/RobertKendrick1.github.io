After we have actually cleaned up the body, and the fixed parts are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be tricky, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around.
