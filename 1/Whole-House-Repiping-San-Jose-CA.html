<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the required instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become polluted. There is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health threat if permitted to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, in addition to checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
