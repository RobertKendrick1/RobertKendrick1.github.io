No, it is not a frequent event, but it does take place regularly than you think! Typically it takes place in the evening when you don't notice the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a new pipe. This makes construction projects easily the most common cause of backflow problems.
