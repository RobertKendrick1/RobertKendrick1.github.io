<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets ought to absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be changed. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural stability of the home.</p>
<p>Leaks can happen if the seal between the tank and bowl fails, or the seal at the floor drain stops working.
