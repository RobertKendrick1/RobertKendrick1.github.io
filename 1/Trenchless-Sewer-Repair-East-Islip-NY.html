<p>With all the house water purification systems - including salt-free residential water softeners - that are on the marketplace, how do you decide what is right for your house? Make certain to compare water softeners based upon your home's water and your family's water usage. An authorized EcoWater Pro can identify your water and advise the very best choice for your home.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
