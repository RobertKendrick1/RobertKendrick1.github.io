The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if needed, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This implies the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
