<h3>Drain Cleaning in Westmoreland Tennessee</h2>
<p>Everyday use must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can also occur if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a stable and safe place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you must wait until after the cycle is completed and then examined the system for fractures or broken fittings. You should also inspect to ensure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>

You will wish to install the softener in a dry, level area, like a basement or garage. It will need to be near to the water's main line, an electric outlet to switch on the system, and a drain for the salt water service from the regrowth cycle.</p>
