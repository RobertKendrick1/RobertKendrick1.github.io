<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components inoperable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain correctly or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help.

At other times, however, parts of a drain may need to be dismantled, examined, and cleared prior to being replaced. In many cases, a handyman might figure out that a replacement part is essential (like a tailpiece, pvc, or reducer  trap) to ensure regular operation for your drain.
