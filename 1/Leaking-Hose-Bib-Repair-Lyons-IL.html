<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at Lyons IL?</h3>

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the offender. However not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
