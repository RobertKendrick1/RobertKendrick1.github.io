The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the structure; extra, more significant costs can take place if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for homeowners.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is typical in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
