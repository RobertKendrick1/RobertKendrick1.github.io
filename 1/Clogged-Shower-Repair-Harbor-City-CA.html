<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and costly plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Plumbing problems aren't simply tough to discover, they're also efficient in causing some serious damage. Pinhole leaks, for example, are so little that they just launch a number of beads at a time. That's far too little to cause a drop in water pressure, or any of the other symptoms that might warn of a leak in the system. A journeyman plumber and his assistant arrived during the appointed time period. They unplugged the sinks, tidied up and suggested a tool to be used in the future.</p>
