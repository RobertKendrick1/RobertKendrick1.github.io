You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, preparing the system for the next flush.
