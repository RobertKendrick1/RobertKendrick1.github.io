<p>As a locally-owned business, stability and duty are incredibly essential to building a track record for quality. One typical method for a home's water system to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue could spread greatly if that contaminated water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in specific residences, it also prevents wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and contaminating the public water system.</p>
<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and germs from becoming an issue in your water system by sending an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system.
