And often you're simply all set for a kitchen upgrade. , if you desire one or more sinks in your home to have soft water for much easier meal washing, under-sink and counter top softeners can assist.

<p>Place the flange on the top of the sink, and attach the fastening system on the underside (Image 1). It is handy to apply pressure on the flange from above using a second set of hands or a heavy things. This will keep the flange in location while connecting the fastening system below. Ensure the plumber's putty is noticeably exuding beyond the edge of the flange all around (Image 2). Get rid of the excess putty with a rag as soon as a complete seal has formed.</p>
