<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Hampstead NC</h3>
<p>IRWD is devoted to delivering safe, high quality water to customers. Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water provided to our consumers is kept devoid of harmful pollutants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices containing a nonpotable substance, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination might take place when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating and cooling system, into the safe and clean water system. This can occur through a process referred to as backflow.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of house centers carry only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet.
