<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in Estero FL</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system must be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
