<p>And so, we see the transition from substantial transport pipelines (aqueducts) providing water to whole cities to big distribution pipes (mains) servicing smaller neighborhoods or big facilities, to medium circulation pipelines and finally to little service pipelines. Each stage in the water supply and circulation system has to handle differing circulation rates, circulation speeds and pressure heads, along with different levels of direct exposure to potential backwash or pollutant infiltration and the subsequent need for security with backflow preventers.</p>
<p>While UPC does differentiate in between residential and commercial systems, its leniency just applies to residential systems utilizing drinkable water piping products. In one- and two-family homes, AWWA states that backflow preventers are not required on sprinkler systems built of authorized drinkable material and developed to flow water, so it does not stagnate. Rather, backflow requirements for domestic plumbing might use to those lawn sprinkler.</p>
