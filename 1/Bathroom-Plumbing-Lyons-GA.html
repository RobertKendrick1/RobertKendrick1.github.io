Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
