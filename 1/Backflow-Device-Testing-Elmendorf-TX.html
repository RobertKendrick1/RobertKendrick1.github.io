Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water delivered to our customers is kept devoid of hazardous impurities. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices containing a nonpotable compound, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination might take place when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating & cooling system, into the potable water system. This can take place through a process called backflow.</p>

It may be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to examine when this takes place.</p>
