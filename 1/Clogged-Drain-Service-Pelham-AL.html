<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Pelham AL</h3>
<p>When water rises in the bowl without stopping and spills onto the floor, a plunger most likely won't be the best solution. In fact, there is probably an obstruction in the trap or drainpipe, or there could even be a larger problem in the sewer line We have comprehensive experience dealing with all kinds of toilet emergency situations and can quickly and precisely employ the ideal solution for your particular scenario. We're focused on lasting solutions, not fast band-aid repairs.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
