Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to become certified.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention protects drinkable water supply from possible dangers. There are over 10,000 reported cases of backflow contamination each year.
