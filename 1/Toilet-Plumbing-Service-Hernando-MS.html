<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains considerable quantities of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon for how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a nuisance-- for its numerous intended usages around your home.</p>
