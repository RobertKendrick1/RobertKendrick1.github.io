<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is heated straight whenever it's needed. Tankless systems particularly utilize a component that heats up water when the tap is turned on. The water is continually heated up as long as the tap remains on. The water stops being warmed if the tap is right away switched off. The heating temperature is normally pre-set to match your needs and preferences. Since they only heat water when needed, tankless electrical water heaters utilize less power than traditional water heaters.</p>
