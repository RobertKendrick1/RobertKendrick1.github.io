<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal preference. An authorization is not required for repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages offered changes are not made in the existing piping or components. A common water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, wide brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a neighboring drain or drywell.</p>
