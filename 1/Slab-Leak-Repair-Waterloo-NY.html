<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less vital things that can deteriorate or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
