<p>Both irrigation water and clean water supply are at high risk of coming into contact with contaminants due to backflows. Numerous faucets can have a low-flow aerator installed at the outlet end of the water spout. Aerators are designed to control water circulation from faucets by introducing air into the water as it streams from the spout. Including air in this way maintains constant water pressure, which causes the fixture to use less water.</p>
