An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a new pipe. This makes building tasks easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks use huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
