<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in different parts of the plumbing system, a lot of typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low circulation problems or perhaps stop a fixture from flowing altogether. The next typical problem that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which happens when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it lowers the readily available volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as displayed in Photo 1. If extra pressure on the flapper doesn't stop the running noise, water is likely leaving through a broken or worn away overflow tube. In that case, you have to detach the tank from the bowl and replace the entire flush valve. Given that the overflow tube is hardly ever the cause of a running toilet, we will not cover that repair here.</p>
