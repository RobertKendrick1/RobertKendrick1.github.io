<p>Many softeners have a bypass developed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to supply some kind of maintenance to it and even while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's smart to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to keep the system.</p>
