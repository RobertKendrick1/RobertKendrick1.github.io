<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Germantown OH</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
