<p>Many residential homes have roof gutters that stream into downspout drains that direct water far from your home.

Please note that Roto-Rooter does not clean roofing system gutters or rectangular aluminum rain gutter downspouts.</p>
<p>All water softeners will come with some kind of secondary tank. This is where the homeowner will need to add water softener salt.
