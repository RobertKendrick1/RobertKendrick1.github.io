<p>Root Intrusion: Root invasion describes what takes place when tree roots start to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This occurs since the moisture in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can trigger blockages, breaks, and back-ups which might lead to extensive home damage. Keep an eye out for moist, green patches in your lawn, a relentless sewage odor in or around your house, an uptick in insect and rodent activity, and sluggish drains, as these are all typical indications of root intrusion.</p>

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the culprit. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper.

Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
