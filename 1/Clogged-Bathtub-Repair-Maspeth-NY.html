<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
