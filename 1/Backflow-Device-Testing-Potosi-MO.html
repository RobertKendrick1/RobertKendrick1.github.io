<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a considerable clog that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
