I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a significant clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed.
