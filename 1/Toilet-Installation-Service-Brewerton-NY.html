<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Brewerton NY</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can cause leakages. As these leakages occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
