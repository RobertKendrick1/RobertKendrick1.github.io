<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts must be gotten rid of and replaced with new rubber parts. It is essential that just initial factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to use and changing the rubber from the initial factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
