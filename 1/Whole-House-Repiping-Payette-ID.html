Calcium, magnesium and numerous other minerals carry favorable charges, so water softeners use salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with drinkable water, you are required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, drinkable and watering, you are also needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
