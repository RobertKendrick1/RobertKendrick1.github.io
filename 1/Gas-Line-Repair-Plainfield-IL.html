<p>Pull the 2 lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the harmed fuel lines.

The relief valve is created to open and release water to the outside if either check valve must leak. An RPZ will occasionally release small amounts of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ needs to be installed in locations that are not subject to water damage and permit appropriate drainage.</p>
