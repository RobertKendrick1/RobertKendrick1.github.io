<p>Pull the 2 lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the harmed fuel lines. When you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer, a little cylindrical fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank.

<p>This is a totally legitimate concern that we hear a lot. The disposal system is not, obviously, as crucial as your hot water heater, water line, or drainpipes. Nonetheless, it includes a fair amount of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a reasonably small cylindrical device installed under the kitchen drain.

The relief valve is created to open and release water to the outside if either check valve must leak. An RPZ will occasionally release small amounts of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ needs to be installed in locations that are not subject to water damage and permit appropriate drainage.</p>
