<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual preference. A license is not needed for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided alterations are not made in the existing piping or components.

A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a neighboring drainpipe or drywell.</p>
<p>A water softener works by using electrical charges to remove the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and lots of other minerals bring positive charges, so water softeners utilize salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions.

If you have two meters, drinkable and watering, you are also needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
