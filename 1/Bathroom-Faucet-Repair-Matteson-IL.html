<p>Most of the times, when you have a clogged drain or toilet, an auger is utilized to unclog the pipe and eliminate the particles. Depending upon the intensity of the clog, or how far into your sewer pipe the clog is located, a high powered auger might be needed.

<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
