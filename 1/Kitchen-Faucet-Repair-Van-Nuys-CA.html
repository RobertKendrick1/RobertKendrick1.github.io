One method to test for any leaks in your plumbing is to shut off all water home appliances in the house and outdoors (sprinklers, pipes, and so on). Then locate and watch the numbers on your house's water meter. You have a leak if the numbers go up after 20-30 minutes. And the faster those numbers increase, the bigger the leak.</p>

<p>While UPC does differentiate in between residential and commercial systems, its leniency only applies to residential systems utilizing safe and clean water piping materials. In one- and two-family houses, AWWA specifies that backflow preventers are not needed on lawn sprinkler built of authorized drinkable product and designed to flow water, so it does not stagnate. Rather, backflow requirements for domestic plumbing might apply to those lawn sprinkler.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, however if you've been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
