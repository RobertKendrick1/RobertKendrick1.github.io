<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. An action crew is available for preliminary investigation of sewer emergency situations every day of the year. If sewage from the City-maintained portion of the sewer system backs up through toilets or sinks, call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700.

If the problem is the outcome of excessive storm water in the system, you may need to wait up until the storm has actually gone away to have actually the backup solved.</p>
<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>A plumbing license offers three inspections. Extra inspections are $50.00 each. Inspections employed on work not completed, not correctly installed, or on an unattainable home will need re-inspection. It is the permit holder's obligation to reschedule the inspection and make arrangements for the plumbing inspector to access the property.</p>
<p>Other signs you might need to repipe include rust in your supply of water, low water pressure, and damp spots in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these are common signs that precede repiping services, they do not always suggest repiping is the only option. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will take a look at the problem to determine the best strategy.</p>
