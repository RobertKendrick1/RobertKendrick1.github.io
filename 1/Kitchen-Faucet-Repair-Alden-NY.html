<p>Most houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the outer finish of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>

If you're not comfy making electrical connections for your garbage disposal installation, you can buy a disposal that already has a cable connected. Ask at your home center or device shop, or search online for 'waste disposal unit with cable connected.</p>
