<p>Wood pipes were used in London and in other places during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and conduits, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
