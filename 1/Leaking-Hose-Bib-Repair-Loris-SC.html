When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. There is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health threat if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for efficiency, along with examined every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
