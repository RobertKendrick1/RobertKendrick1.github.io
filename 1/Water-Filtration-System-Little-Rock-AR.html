<p>SofTap's water softening technology is well-suited for household, commercial, and commercial applications, consisting of the prevention of limescale accumulation in households and scaling in industrial water treatment systems, in addition to improving present reverse osmosis treatment systems. The innovation is easier and more affordable than other softening systems on the marketplace today that use zeolites, which must be regrowed using brine, or membrane nanofiltration that requires substantial water use and high pressure.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. A lot of house centers carry just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

It is essential to get out in front of any problems as fast as possible. The quicker you respond to a problem, the better possibility you'll need to save time and money on hot water heater services.</p>
