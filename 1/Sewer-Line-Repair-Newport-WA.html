<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system should be constantly monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the very first most apparent signs of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent serious damage to your house.
