<h3>Water Leak Repair in Pembroke Pines Florida</h2>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is generally used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
