<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Montrose MI</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
