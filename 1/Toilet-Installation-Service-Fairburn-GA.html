<h3>Tips On Basic Plumbing Emergencies Fairburn GA</h3>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line obstructions are not something a property owner can fix.

TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to repair the drain and recognize issue. If you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is particularly helpful in finding an issue.</p>

This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as hard water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
