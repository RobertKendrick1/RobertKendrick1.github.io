<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it includes. When tough water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your home. Once the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it must be restored (cleaned up). Salt is normally utilized in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start again.</p>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are set up in locations where water might trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
