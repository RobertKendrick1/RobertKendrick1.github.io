<p>A & frac13; HP or 1/2 HP waste disposal unit system can grind soft, non-fibrous foods. There is very little insulation in the weaker designs. Here are some common types of garbage disposals you may wish to think about. There are usually 2 types of disposals: aluminum and stainless steel. Aluminum disposals are the most affordable, costing about $70 to $150 a pop but are susceptible to rust and leaking.</p>
<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mainly time related. If everything is prepared, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or more of time. If things need to be modified, changed, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours required and therefore the total expenses. Many plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with most disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours total, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
<p>The typical plumber's per hour wage is $68-$ 138. Sometimes basic repairs, such as unclogging a drain or a toilet, will have a repaired rate of about $220 unless there are extenuating scenarios. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13. Some plumbers will charge a cost to look at your situation and inform you what needs to be done, however if you hire them, that charge will be deducted from the bill. A plumber may charge $50-$ 100 to come and diagnose the problem. 2 Needing to call a plumber after hours, on the weekend, or on a holiday will cost more.</p>
