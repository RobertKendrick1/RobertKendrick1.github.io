A license is not needed for repairs which include only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions offered changes are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A typical water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, wide brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line.
