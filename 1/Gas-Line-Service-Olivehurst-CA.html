<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc created and built a smaller model that operated on the very same principle however could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise developed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
