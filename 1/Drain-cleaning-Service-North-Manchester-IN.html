Local plumber quoted cost of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ delighted I inspected around. Under the sink, place a pail or pan below the drain, then use locking-jaw pliers or a pipe wrench to disconnect the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's waste pipe. To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
