<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health risk if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of sickness or illness.</p>
<p>After arriving after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together however declared they wouldn't take obligation if it dripped now since of some undefined oddities in how my sink was put together. After they provided me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, since I never wish to see this company again.</p>
<p>You live in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to corrode and burst when they get old. If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you do not currently have one. This usually includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
