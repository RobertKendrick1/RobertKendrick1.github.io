As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a nuisance-- for its lots of desired usages around your house.</p>
