<p>Waste disposal unit guarantees last approximately 5 years, however they can vary in between 2 and ten years. Given that the typical life-span of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you may want to buy an extended warranty. Most service warranties cover the cost to repair and replace regular wear and tear failures. To avoid more malfunctions, house owners need to stay up to date with regular maintenance of their garbage disposal.</p>
<p>Sometimes, your faucet can be the one causing sink problems. If you have a leaky faucet, an irregular water stream, faucet knobs that squeak, shrieking or clanking sounds when you turn the faucet on, or a faucet that's just old and doesn't operate well, our commercial and residential sink repair services can help. Whether it's your kitchen sink, bathroom sink, or a sink in your laundry room, we'll evaluate the issue and find a service.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
