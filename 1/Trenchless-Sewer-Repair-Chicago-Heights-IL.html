Routine water heater maintenance can also extend the life of the appliance and help prevent other problems or unexpected leaks.

<p>A new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the within the used pipe with epoxy paint. Often during the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes.

Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up needing to be correctly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
