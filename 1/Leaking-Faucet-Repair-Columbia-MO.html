<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts need to be eliminated and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. It is very important that just original factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to use and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>Responsibility for installation falls upon the owner of the co-op or the home or condo board. Owners and boards of buildings that are released an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer must file plans with the DEP within thirty days. If the DEP has not received certification from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being set up within that time, a Notification of Violation will be sent. Lawbreakers will be accountable for a civil charge of up to $1,000 released by the Environmental protection Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can eventually cause civil and criminal proceedings and actions, along with the termination of water service to the structure.</p>
