<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills with firmness ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is normally used in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>

Prolonged warranty: Most disposals feature a minimum of a 1-year warranty, but if you purchase one with a lifetime guarantee (15+ years), it will most likely be more costly.

<p>One of the most serious hot water heater problems is leaking water, which is in some cases brought on by malfunctioning temperature and pressure (T&P) relief valves. If the leak is brought on by rust in the water tank, however, you'll likely need to replace the water heater. On this page are various Hyperlinks to assist you in working with the City of Buffalo's Department of Permit and Inspection Services.</p>
