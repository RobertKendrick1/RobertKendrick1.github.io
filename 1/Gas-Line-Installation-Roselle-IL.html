<p>As soon as the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>
