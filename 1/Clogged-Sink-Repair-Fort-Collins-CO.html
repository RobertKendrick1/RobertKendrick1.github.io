<p>The primary media contained within a water softener is called ion exchange resin. This resin is essentially an insoluble matrix normally in the shape of little (1-2 mm diameter) beads. The product has highly developed structure of pores on the surface of which are sites with easily trapped and released ions. This procedure of trapping of ions happens with a synchronised launching of other ions resulting in the term ion-exchange. Ion exchange resins can be made to selectively prefer one, or maybe numerous different kinds of ions. Typically, these resins are based on cross-linked polystyrene.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
