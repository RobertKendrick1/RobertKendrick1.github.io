<p>Waste disposal unit are a vital feature in any contemporary kitchen. If you reside in an older house, your sink may not have one, requiring you to be diligent about keeping food scraps from streaming down the drain. It's also possible for a disposal to unexpectedly break, bringing cooking or cleanup to a grinding halt. Copper pipes = $1.50-$ 2.00 per linear foot. Copper pipes are eco-friendly and are resistant to splitting. Nevertheless, they're also the most costly in this list and in locations with difficult water (like Florida) they can develop pinhole leaks.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug package that I purchased separately from the disposal unit. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>When shopping for a new flapper, your best option is to attempt and find the very same flapper that originally featured your existing flush valve. The easiest way to do that is by looking up your toilet design and selecting the flapper suggested for that model.
