<p>We had an excellent experience with Joe Boyette, he was really professional, considerate, competent. We had a great deal of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month period. We likewise had to replace a water and a bathroom heater unrelated to the fire, but we felt confident in Joe's capabilities. We made the decision to stay with Joe, although we felt Mr Rooter rates were definitely on the high-end. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>

<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Clinton NC</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
