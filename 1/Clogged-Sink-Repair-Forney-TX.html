<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the problem if this is the case. You may need to look into utilizing a high pressure water system to eliminate the clog.

Other laws can require the installation of more complicated and advanced backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices installed to avoid backflow range from the reasonably basic to the complex and very sophisticated.</p>
