The energy effectiveness of a storage hot water heater is shown by its Energy Factor (EF). The more efficient the hot water heater the greater the EF rating. Nevertheless, just because a water heater has a greater EF worth, it does not always indicate it will have lower operating expense. You also have to think about the fuel source.</p>

<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually often been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mostly to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment.

The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
