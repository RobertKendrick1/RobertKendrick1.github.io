<p>When the components are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback turned off stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
