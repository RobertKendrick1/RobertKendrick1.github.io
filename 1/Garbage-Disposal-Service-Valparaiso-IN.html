<p>When lime is added to the water, it changes the water chemistry, triggering the calcium to come out of the service. The particles of calcium combine, end up being heavier than the remainder of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next step of the treatment process. Flexible gas lines are typically more suitable to inflexible lines, particularly in locations where earthquakes are more common and for the connection in between the supply and home appliance. Versatile gas lines are less likely to be disconnected in a natural catastrophe which reduces the threat of an explosion or fire.</p>
