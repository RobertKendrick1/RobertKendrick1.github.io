<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in San Bruno CA</h3>
<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are numerous aspects that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that speed up rust Likewise, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable type of corrosion control. Therefore, considering all these factors, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of home centers carry only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close.
