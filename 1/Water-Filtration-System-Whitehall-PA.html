<p>Most houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the outer covering of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
