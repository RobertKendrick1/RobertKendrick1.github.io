<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Humble TX</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to deal with tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
