<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers carry just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is typical in our market and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
