<h3>Four Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Greenwood SC</h3>
<p>Backflow is dangerous because it can pollute the general public drinking supply with contaminants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and harmful chemicals. In 2010, for instance, trainees at a Bowling Green, Kentucky grade school suffered queasiness and other symptoms after a contractor dealing with the HVAC system caused the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. A lot of home centers bring only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

<p>A cross connection is a connection between a potable drinking supply of water and a possible source of contamination or pollution. Under the arrangements of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1971, the Epa (EPA) established national requirements for safe drinking water. Each state is needed to enforce the various policies of the Safe Drinking Water Act and how it relates to its state laws.</p>
