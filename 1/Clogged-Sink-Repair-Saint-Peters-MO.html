The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system.

Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can result in leaks.
