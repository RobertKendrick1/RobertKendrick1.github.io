<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. A response team is available for initial examination of sewer emergencies every day of the year. If sewage from the City-maintained portion of the sewer system backs up through toilets or sinks, call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700. City workers will examine and get rid of obstructions in the mainline sewer and the part of the service line that the City is accountable for. If the issue is the result of excessive storm water in the system, you might have to wait up until the storm has actually decreased to have actually the backup fixed.</p>
<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
