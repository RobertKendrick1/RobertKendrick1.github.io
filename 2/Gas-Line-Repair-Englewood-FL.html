For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>Toilet repair can look deceptively basic when you see a diagram of the working parts. You think, Sure, I can do that," but checked out the instructions carefully.

Even if you make it this far, the only thing you can do if your brand-new tank flush valve does not work is check for leaks" and make modifications."
