<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has frequently been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mainly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening just eliminates solidity minerals and eliminates problems that are an annoyance and not a hazard to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and drawbacks, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
