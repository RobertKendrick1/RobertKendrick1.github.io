For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that accelerate rust Also, there is an absence of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective kind of rust control. Hence, thinking about all these aspects, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
