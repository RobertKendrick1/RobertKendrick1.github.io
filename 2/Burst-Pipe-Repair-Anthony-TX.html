<p>The toilet takes an actually very long time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout regular operation, the pressure in between the two check valves-- referred to as the zone of reduced pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure.

When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the infected water to become a health hazard if permitted to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, along with inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
