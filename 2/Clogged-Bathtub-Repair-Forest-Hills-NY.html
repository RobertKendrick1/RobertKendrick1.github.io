<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
