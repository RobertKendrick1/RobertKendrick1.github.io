<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is typical in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can achieve this.</p>
