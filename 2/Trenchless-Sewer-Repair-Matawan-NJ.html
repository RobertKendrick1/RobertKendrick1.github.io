<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the needed instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can become polluted. If permitted to return to the water system, there is capacity for the contaminated water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, as well as checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
