<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler normally are set up in areas where water could trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic devices.

If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
