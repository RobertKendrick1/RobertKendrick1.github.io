<p>Your sewer line is among the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or broken, it could wreak unwanted concerns on your home.

No matter what sort of hot water heater you have or have an interest in, the professionals at Timothy Off can help. Contact us today for our hot water heater installation services. For instance, if your kitchen sink is supported since you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a fast drain snaking can break up the blockage and send it down the pipes. We suggest you go with drain snaking instead of utilizing strong chemical drain cleaners. These store-bought cleaners might do more damage than great by rusting your pipes.</p>
