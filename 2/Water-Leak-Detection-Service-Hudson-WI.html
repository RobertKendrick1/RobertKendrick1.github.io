Your hot water heater must be flushed as soon as a year. If you have a 15‐year‐old water heater that's never been flushed, it might have up to 8 inches of sediment at the bottom of the tank. That suggests eight fewer inches of hot water, not to point out the fact that your faucet water is being heated in a tank with calcium, scale, rust, dirt, iron, and sulfuric‐smelling bacteria.</p>
