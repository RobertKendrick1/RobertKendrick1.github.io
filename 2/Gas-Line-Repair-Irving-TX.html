Liquified minerals found in difficult water can clog drains, build scale in pipes, and make your appliances less efficient.

<p>The toilet takes a really very long time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout typical operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves-- described as the zone of lowered pressure-- is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and figure out the cause of the problem. The line was plainly weakening; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
