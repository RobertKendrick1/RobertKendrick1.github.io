<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion.

Since opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads.
