<p>Release piping linked to a storm sewer shall be geared up with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices advises a DCV assembly on dry or damp lawn sprinkler unless there is a danger of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>

In some areas of Virginia, where the water is specifically tough with high mineral material, you may need to flush the water heater more often.</p>
