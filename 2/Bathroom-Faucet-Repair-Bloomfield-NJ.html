<p>Garbage disposal guarantees last approximately 5 years, but they can range in between 2 and 10 years. Since the average life expectancy of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you may want to purchase a prolonged service warranty. Most service warranties cover the cost to repair and replace normal wear and tear failures.
