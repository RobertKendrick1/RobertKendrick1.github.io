<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the required instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. If permitted to re-enter the water system, there is potential for the infected water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for effectiveness, as well as inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
