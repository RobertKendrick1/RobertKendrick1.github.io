Ensure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cord when you connect the electrical wiring harness to the disposer.</p>
<p>If you discover an odor or unpleasant odor coming from your unit, which is not uncommon, consider investing in a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where nasty smells can leave. These flanges are simple and commonly readily available to install, costing around $30 in the house enhancement or hardware stores. Turn off the supply of water to your home at the main line.
