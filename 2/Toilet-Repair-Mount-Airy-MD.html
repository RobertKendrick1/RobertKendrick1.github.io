<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct impact on your security, convenience, comfort, and dependability than your plumbing system. This is extremely essential! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to press the waste out of your drain system. Current policies restrict the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We provide two types of water treatment systems for hard water: Advantage Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
