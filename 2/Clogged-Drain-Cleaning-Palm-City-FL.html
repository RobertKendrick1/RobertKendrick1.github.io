<p>In some cases, our specialists will advise that you replace your hot water heater rather than invest in repairs. This is usually the case when the hot water heater is more than ten years old or the cost of repairs would amount to majority the cost of an entire brand-new unit. Sometimes a problematic toilet simply needs a small adjustment and life is back to regular.
