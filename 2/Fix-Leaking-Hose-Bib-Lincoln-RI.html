<h3>Water Leak Repair in Lincoln Rhode Island</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had actually backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did a minimum of three efforts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his knowledge and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the particles went down the newly cleaned main drain. By including perseverence and persistence the job was done to my total fulfillment.</p>
