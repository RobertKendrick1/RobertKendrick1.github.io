<p>Both irrigation water and clean water supply are at high danger of entering contact with contaminants due to backflows. Numerous faucets can have a low-flow aerator set up at the outlet end of the water spout. Aerators are created to control water flow from faucets by presenting air into the water as it streams from the spout. Adding air in this way preserves consistent water pressure, which causes the fixture to utilize less water.</p>
<p>Most automobiles have a metal line that runs the length of the automobile with rubber fuel lines linking at either end, one at the fuel tank and the other to the engine.

<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to avoid backflow. The standard means of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow.

The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
