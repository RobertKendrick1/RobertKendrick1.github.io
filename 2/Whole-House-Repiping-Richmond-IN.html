When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system. Current guidelines restrict the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines.

The resultant space breaks any potential siphon prior to it can occur, avoiding polluting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more complex and advanced backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets set up to prevent backflow variety from the relatively easy to the complex and very sophisticated.</p>
