<p>Other pipe repair strategies include our Pipe Pull strategy and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull strategy interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into location. All new replacement pipes have a predicted life expectancy of one a century and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another effective technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically gets rid of the need for broken pipe elimination. By inserting a solidifying lining product which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a brand-new pipe is developed inside the broken one.</p>
