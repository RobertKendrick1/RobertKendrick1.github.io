<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Morehead City NC</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
