<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health risk if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of illness or disease.</p>
<p>Whenever you flush your toilet, you'll discover that water runs to refill the bowl. Nevertheless, in a correctly working toilet, the water needs to stop running once the bowl is filled to its appropriate capacity. Chances are you have an internal leak and water is being discarded down the overflow if your toilet continues to run. These leakages are exceptionally inefficient, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up traveling through the overflow.</p>
