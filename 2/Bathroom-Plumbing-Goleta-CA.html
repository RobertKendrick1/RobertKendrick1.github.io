<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is heated straight whenever it's required. Tankless systems specifically use an element that warms up water when the tap is turned on. The water is constantly warmed as long as the tap remains on. If the tap is immediately switched off, the water stops being warmed. The heating temperature level is normally pre-set to fit your needs and preferences. Tankless electric water heaters utilize less power than conventional water heaters because they only heat water when required.</p>
