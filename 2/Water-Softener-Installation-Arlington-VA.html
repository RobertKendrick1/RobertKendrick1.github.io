<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may have to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug kit that I bought independently from the disposal unit. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Before choice and installation, refer to manufacturers literature for temperature level varieties. All assemblies should be secured from freezing temperature levels and if set up where temperature levels will reach 100 degrees F or above, a warm water type assembly should be utilized. Seek advice from makers specifications for recommendations. When looking for plumbing services in the area, be specific with your needs and ask candidates if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the sophisticated experience and licenses connected with a plumbing contractor.</p>
