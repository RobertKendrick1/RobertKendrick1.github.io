<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Cudahy WI</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Regrettably, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leakages take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these problems.</p>
