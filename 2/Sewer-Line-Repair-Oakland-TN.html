<p>As an ESSENTIAL SERVICES COMPANIES, we remain Available and open to assist with any of your plumbing, drain, heating, cooling or electrical needs. The waste disposal unit is among the most misused appliances in the whole home. Few property owners realize that a disposal is designed specifically to deal with food residue rinsed from a plate-- not whole pieces of leftovers! Big quantities of food can rapidly overwhelm the system and trigger a substantial clog. That's why Pratt Plumbing receives a lot of telephone call requesting waste disposal unit repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>There are two types of water softeners, a salt based water softener and a salt-free water softener Salt based water softeners will provide you more of the slick" sensation in the shower and you will notice the soap creating more bubbles. Other benefits you will see include brighter colors in your clothing, minimized scale build-up on your showers and softer skin.</p>

<p>Won't drain - The unit might not be chopping food effectively and waste may have clogged the drain pipe. However, if there are numerous leakages within the system, or if there is evidence of corrosion in several locations, it is most likely time to repipe. A water softener is loaded with resin beads. Hard water with calcium and magnesium streams through this resin and, in a process called ion exchange, the solidity ions in the water trade locations with soft ions on the resin beads. The result is soft water.</p>
<p>Does it look like your drains are always slow or clogged? Often, this is brought on by built-up sediment and other products that are causing a clog in your sewer drain.

<p>Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can help. A waste disposal unit is a necessary kitchen device in most houses today. While many kitchen sink disposers can handle nearly any type of food waste, they are not indestructible. When a fork, bone or other object jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Worn impellers on older disposals can end up being inefficient, increasing the risk of drain clogs.</p>
