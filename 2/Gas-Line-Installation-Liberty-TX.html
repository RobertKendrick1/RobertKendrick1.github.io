A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal might likewise be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regrowth procedures. A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. It is most likely broken and simply needs to be replaced if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
<p>Duty for installation falls upon the owner of the residential or commercial property or the co-op or condo board.
