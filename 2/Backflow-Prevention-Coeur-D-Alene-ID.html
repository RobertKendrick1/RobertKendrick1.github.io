<h3>How to Do Home Plumbing Inspection Yourself in Coeur D Alene ID</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system needs to be continually kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
