Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure.
