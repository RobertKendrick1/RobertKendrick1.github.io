Features such as these include cost, and aren't that reliable. Your best strategy is to get the water heater with the 12 year service warranty. Chlorinated Polyvinylchloride Piping (CPVC) piping materials cost from $0.40 to $1.56 per linear foot.

For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then unfavorable or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>

In some cases it may be essential to filter the water before it gets to your softener to avoid fouling. If the resin becomes fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Cleaners need to be utilized according to manufacturer instructions to avoid contamination.</p>
