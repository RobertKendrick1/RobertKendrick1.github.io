<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Most house centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models.
