In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices advises a DCV assembly on dry or damp sprinkler systems unless there is a danger of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
<p>In addition to the garbage disposal system, there are a variety of upgrades and parts that you might need to take into account when weighing the waste disposal unit installation cost.
