<p>Examples of backflow conditions consist of backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can save your plumbing system from unneeded clogs even more down the water lines. In some instances, resins can not be washed of impurities and will need to be replaced. (This need to not hold true if the resin is regularly regenerated and kept.) Consult your water softener dealer for details on resin replacement.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, allowing air to enter the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient climatic requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
