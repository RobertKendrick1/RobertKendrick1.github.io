<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the structure; additional, more significant expenses can take place if the drop in water pressure ends up being a concern for residents. A PE or RA can help identify if installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>
