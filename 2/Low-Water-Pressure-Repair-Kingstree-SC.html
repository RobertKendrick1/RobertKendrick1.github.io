<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Kingstree SC</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather an annoyance-- for its many intended uses around your home.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you need a minor toilet repair or a complete replacement, we'll do our best to supply you with service as quickly as possible. Bottom line: Hard water can make cosmetic and domestic cleaning items less efficient. This can result in irritated skin or even a broken washing machine. It's why a lot of cleaning items today contain chelating agents or other types of water softeners.</p>
<p>For the most part, when you have a clogged drain or toilet, an auger is utilized to unclog the pipe and eliminate the debris. Depending upon the severity of the clog, or how far into your sewer pipe the clog is located, a high powered auger might be needed.
