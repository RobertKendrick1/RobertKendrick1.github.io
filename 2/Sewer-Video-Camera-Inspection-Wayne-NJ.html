<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
