<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most obvious indications of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy issue such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid severe damage to your house.

<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
