Each and every installation ought to be looked at on a private basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of sprinkler systems includes the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire defense system are designed to match the risk that exists in the locations they are set up in. As building types and contents of these structures can be really different, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be created and set up to meet that specific hazard or need. An airplane garage will need a very different fire security system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would likewise differ significantly.</p>
