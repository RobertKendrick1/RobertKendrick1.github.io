<p>As soon as the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>
