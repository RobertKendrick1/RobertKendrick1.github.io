<p>Because the copper pipes have actually not had a chance to become coated inside, New houses constructed with copper pipes are specifically susceptible to corrosive water conditions. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a period of 3 to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Numerous brand-new homes are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>

Toilet Runs Periodically - Don't you hate it when the toilet runs 5 minutes after you flushed? It typically indicates there is an issue with the flapper, or the toilet is leaking water somewhere.</p>
<p>Blending vaporized salt with rock salt is not advised, as this could clog the softening tank. It is recommended that you enable your system to go empty of one kind of salt before adding another to prevent the occurrence of any problems. In any case, when you're preparing a water heater replacement, play it safe. Call your local department of inspections and ask if you need a license. And make certain a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>

<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are lots of aspects that speed up rust in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that accelerate deterioration Also, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of corrosion control. Hence, thinking about all these factors, along with results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
