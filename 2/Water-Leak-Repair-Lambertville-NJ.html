<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive product.

Make sure to buy a circuitry package with the appropriate power ranking and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). Make sure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cable when you connect the circuitry harness to the disposer.</p>
