<h3>Unclog Toilet in Union City New Jersey</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did a minimum of 3 attempts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his knowledge and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the particles decreased the newly cleaned main drain. By adding perseverence and persistence the task was done to my complete satisfaction.</p>
