It's prevalent for a toilet to have actually worn out parts at some time which causes the toilet to run. What they imply is the toilet won't stop running when someone states a toilet is running.

<p>Backpressure might take place when the safe and clean supply piping is connected to a system or component which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not effectively safeguarded, potable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system.</p>
