<p>Idea: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and inspect the flange and drain for leaks. Backflow - Do you see water reappearing in your sink or shower?

If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, reduced or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
