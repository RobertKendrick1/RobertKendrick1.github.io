When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to press the waste out of your drain system. Present guidelines limit the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We provide two kinds of water treatment systems for tough water: Benefit Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>

It is always a pleasure to work with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outside kitchen sink line which has a "Y".

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, however if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
