<p>. Backflow into a public water system can contaminate the water or pollute in that system (i.e., backflow into a public water supply can make the water in that system hazardous or unusable to consume), and each water provider has a duty to provide water that is functional and safe to consume under all foreseeable situations. In addition, consumers normally have absolute faith that water provided to them through a public water supply is constantly safe to drink. For these reasons, your water district should take precautions to secure its public water supply versus backflow.</p>

<p>At least once every three months, drain water from the tank. In time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper efficiency, and draining pipes a gallon or so assists eliminate the sediment. If you spot a leak and opt for a patching task instead of a repiping job, just bear in mind that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the very same material and they might be next. To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to consider repiping your whole house when you identify a leak.</p>
