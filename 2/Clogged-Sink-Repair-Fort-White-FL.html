Make certain to purchase an electrical wiring set with the appropriate power score and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). When you connect the circuitry harness to the disposer, ensure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cable.</p>

I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
