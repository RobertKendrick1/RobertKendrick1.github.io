<p>You can prevent destruction and disturbance with trenchless sewer repair. Taking apart and redoing landscapes and other structures are the most significant cost and headache of conventional sewer repair. Our plumbers have more than 15 years of experience in this industry.

<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
