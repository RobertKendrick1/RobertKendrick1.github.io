<p>In water distribution systems, water is typically preserved at a significant pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might stop working or be minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
