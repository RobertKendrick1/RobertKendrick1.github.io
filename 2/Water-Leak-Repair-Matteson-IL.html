<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were extremely responsive and timely to send me a bid which was extremely competitive. They were very professional and did an incredible task. I would absolutely call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this staining only appears when hot water is being used, then the rust most likely exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still a problem that needs to be handled right away (you'll likely need a brand-new hot water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
