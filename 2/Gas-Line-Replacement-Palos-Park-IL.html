<p>Providing quality and professional repair, replacement, and installation services for your plumbing. Some jurisdictions likewise permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, since whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>If you decide to try this task yourself, be prepared to keep meticulous track of about a dozen tiny parts (put the stopper in the sink so none of them fall down the drain). There are several faucet designs, so you may not have the ability to tell what to replace till you have actually done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or work with a plumber, this would be a good time to think about whether you wish to upgrade the faucet with a brand-new design.</p>
