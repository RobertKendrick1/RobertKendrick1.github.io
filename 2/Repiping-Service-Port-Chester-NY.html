<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most terrible and widespread water problems: tough water.  Difficult water ruined the contemporary house. Scale develops in your pipes, blocking them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale dramatically shortens the life-span of appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee machine and ice devices. Tough water ruins warm water home appliances. The higher the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will harden and strengthen into solid deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>

<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Port Chester NY</h3>
<p>Repiping a house takes three to five days with a typical cost from $5,500 to $8,500, depending on home's size and the company doing the work. Wood suggests inspecting the credentials of various companies and getting estimates. With all this in mind, it's clear why water softeners are so popular: They remain the least costly and most reliable way to rid your water of bothersome minerals.</p>
<p>If you see rust just in your warm water, then check the status of your hot water heater's anode rod. If you've never done this on your own, you might need a professional to do this. The rust is most likely coming from the inside of your water heater if the anode rod is rusted out. Replace your hot water heater as soon as possible if this is the case. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your hot and cold water taps, you more than likely have corroded piping.</p>
