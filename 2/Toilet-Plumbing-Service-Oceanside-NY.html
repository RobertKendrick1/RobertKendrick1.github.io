<h3>Clogged Sewer Line in Oceanside New York</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>

So, while a chemical drain cleaner might supply a quick fix in the short term, it can cause much more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. A great place to start looking for the leaking kitchen sink plumbing system is below the puddle of water or where you seem to feel the dampness most.</p>
