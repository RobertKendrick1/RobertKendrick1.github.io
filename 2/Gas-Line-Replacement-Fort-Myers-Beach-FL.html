<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Fort Myers Beach FL</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can cause leakages. As these leakages take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these concerns.</p>
