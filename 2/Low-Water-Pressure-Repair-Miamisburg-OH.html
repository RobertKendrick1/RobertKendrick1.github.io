<p>If you discover a smell or unpleasant odor originating from your unit, which is not unusual, consider investing in a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can escape. These flanges are extensively available and simple to install, costing around $30 at home improvement or hardware stores. Turn off the water system to your home at the main line. To avoid leaks from springing during the installation process, shut down the supply of water to your home.
