Where such gadgets are retrofitted for an existing fire protection system, the hydraulics of the sprinkler system style will be inspected to confirm that there will be sufficient water pressure available for satisfying operation of the fire sprinklers.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as displayed in Picture 1. Water is likely leaving through a broken or worn away overflow tube if additional pressure on the flapper does not stop the running noise.
