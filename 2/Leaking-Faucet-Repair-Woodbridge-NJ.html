<p>Woodbury, in addition to many other communities and companies, has actually found the very best way to prevent these spots from occurring is by reducing the variety of times your water softener restores. "Restoring" refers to the method softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it becomes "tired" or complete. However, many water softeners regrow too often, when the filter medium actually isn't complete. This can be corrected by simply resetting your water softener to eliminate less solidity or to run longer in between regrowth cycles.</p>
