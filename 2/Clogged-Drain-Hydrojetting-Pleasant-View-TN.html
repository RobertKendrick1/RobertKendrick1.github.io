Heating water accounts for as much as 20 percent of the average house's energy budget plan. Some gas-fired tankless hot water heater declare to cut energy expenses by up to half.

<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200).
