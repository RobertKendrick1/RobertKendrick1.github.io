<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that manages water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't installed correctly, you may experience an often or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>
