<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab.

Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>
