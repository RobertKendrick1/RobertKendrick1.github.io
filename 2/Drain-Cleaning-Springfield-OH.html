Costs can vary significantly based upon the complexity of the install, and what size pipe and connections each appliance needs.</p>
<p>It's pretty common for debris to wind up being flushed down our drains. Think of how typically food particles, cooking oil and hair winds up in our showers and sinks.

However, if the pipe is continuously leaking and needs regular repairs, we would suggest repiping.
