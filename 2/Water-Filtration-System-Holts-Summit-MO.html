<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial clog, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â€² hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
