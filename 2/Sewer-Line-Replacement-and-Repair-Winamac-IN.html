<p>Polybutylene utilized inside your home can be found near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Caution: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when exiting the wall. Even if copper is showing does not mean you do not have polybutylene pipes. You may need to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>Improperly set up gas lines lead to gas leaks. Gas leaks are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself project. The gas lines have to be adjusted to the best levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house."

The amount of minerals liquified in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>

Utilize your hands for PVC connections or a pipe wrench for metal connections. Place a container underneath the drain pipe to catch any water that leakages out.</p>
