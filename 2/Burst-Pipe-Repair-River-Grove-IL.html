<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to avoid backflow. The standard means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The basic system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
