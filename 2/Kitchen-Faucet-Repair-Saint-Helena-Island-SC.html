<p>Solar water heaters: These environmentally friendly and cost-effective heaters draw energy from the sun to heat water. They need no electricity or gas and can decrease your costs by an approximated 14 to 18%. A water heater installation is not the repair on which to refine your plumbing skills if you're relatively unskilled. So conserve yourself some serious difficulty by being sincere with yourself about where your experience level is.</p>
<p>If your hot water heater has required several repairs over the last few years, it might be time to get it replaced. A good general rule for hot water heater is this: since the life-span of the average hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. If the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your water heater.</p>
<p>You reside in an older home. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and wear away when they get old. You might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one if so. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
