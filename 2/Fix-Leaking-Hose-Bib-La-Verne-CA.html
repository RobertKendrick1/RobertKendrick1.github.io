<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, heater, and boiler, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. Initially, these small deposits are safe, but over time they develop and eventually clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water flow, which puts unnecessary pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called corrosion. Deterioration can actually eat a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it originally was or modify the tolerances triggering parts to not operate in a backflow preventer.

<p>We use quality products. In most circumstances, we attempt to utilize flexible carbon steel to transport gas from the outside gas source to appliances. Flexible steel eliminates the need to cut and piece specific segments of piping together which reduces capacity for gas leaks. Carbon steel possesses additives that can hold up against certain conditions throughout element exposure. Tracer wire is typically used with flexible carbon steel to inform the gas company when a leak happens. We can ensure that these lines are working properly.</p>

<p>Backflow preventers ought to just be repaired when the information collected from the field test shows the assembly has deteriorated in its efficiency below the developed minimum standard. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if essential, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications.
