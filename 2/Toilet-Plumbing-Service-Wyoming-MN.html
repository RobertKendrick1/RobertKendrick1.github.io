When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become infected. If enabled to return to the water system, there is capacity for the contaminated water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for efficiency, along with examined every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
