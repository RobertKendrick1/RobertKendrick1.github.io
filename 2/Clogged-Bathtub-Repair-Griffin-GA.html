<p>In community water system systems, water is normally preserved at a significant pressure to allow water to flow to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your house or company. When the pressure drops for some factor such as might happen when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to eliminate a water or a fire main breaks or some other situation takes place, polluted water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an occurrence, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention approach made use of. The best and most safe type of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). The proper backflow prevention device is needed if an air gap is not possible. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water provider.</p>
