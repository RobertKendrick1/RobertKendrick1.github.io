I really got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's.

Sadly, upon more examination, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
