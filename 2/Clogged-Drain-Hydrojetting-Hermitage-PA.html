Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can attain this.</p>
