<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive material. Some disposer units do not included a power cable connected. Remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1) if this is the case. Be sure to acquire a circuitry kit with the proper power score and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). When you link the electrical wiring harness to the disposer, guarantee the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cord.</p>
<p>As soon as the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut off remains in the closed position.

Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital areas in the assembly.
