<p>Natural gas is a clean-burning and affordable  method to operating appliances and heating homes. There are still some disadvantages, however, as a gas leak can trigger damage to your home, lead to health dangers and worse. To correctly maintain your gas lines, you ought to have them regularly examined by a licensed plumber to help recognize and repair any corrosion and leakage that could be causing unsafe conditions.</p>
<p>Softeners primarily remove calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are often referred to as 'solidity minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they need to be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a substantial red flag that something more serious is incorrect with them.</p>
<p>Having your plumbing repiped can save you cash and time as well as protect your health in the future. After softening a large quantity of hard water, the exchange medium becomes covered with calcium and magnesium ions. The exchange medium should be charged or regrowed (Figure 1)when this occurs.
