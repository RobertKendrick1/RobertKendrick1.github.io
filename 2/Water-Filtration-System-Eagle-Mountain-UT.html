Your home is over 10 years old, and you have never ever had the sewer and drain lines inspected. Some plumbers may get professional discount rates from merchants or kitchen and bath showrooms. If you need a new sink or faucet, compare their costs with what you can find online or in the house enhancement stores. They may be getting you a better offer</p>
