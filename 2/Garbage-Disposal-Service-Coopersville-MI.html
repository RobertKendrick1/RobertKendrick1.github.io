<p>When the end user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water flows in the normal direction from the provider, downstream to fill the user's need. The flow of water presses the spring-loaded check valves open. The tension of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure distinction in the Zone of Reduced Pressure. This distinction in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water streams in the typical direction.</p>
