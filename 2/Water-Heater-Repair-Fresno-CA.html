<p>The drains in the average house get constant use. Hair, food scraps, soap scum, and other debris can slowly develop over time. The drain will gradually slow till it becomes totally clogged. Chemical drain cleaners sold in stores have actually restricted efficiency. Although the drain might appear to clear at first, the result is often temporary and the clog quickly returns.
