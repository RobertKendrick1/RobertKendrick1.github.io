<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal choice. An authorization is not needed for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions supplied alterations are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A typical water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, wide salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a close-by drainpipe or drywell.</p>
