<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair Tips and Techniques at Wellsburg WV</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the perpetrator. But not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger problem too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
