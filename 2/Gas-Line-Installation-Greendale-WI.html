<p>Badly installed gas lines result in gas leakages. Gas leakages are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself job. The gas lines have to be calibrated to the best levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy states that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the 2nd highest energy consuming area of a house, next to cooling and heating. The amount of minerals liquified in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>
