<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were very responsive and prompt to send me a quote which was very competitive. They were very professional and did an incredible job. I would certainly call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration only appears when hot water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still an issue that needs to be dealt with right now (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) but not one that requires repiping.</p>
