<p>IRWD is devoted to providing safe, high quality water to customers. Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water provided to our customers is kept free from harmful pollutants. A vital part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to equipment consisting of a nonpotable compound, this is known as a cross-connection. Contamination may happen when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or cooling and heating system, into the safe and clean water system. This can take place through a process known as backflow.</p>

After they provided me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, because I never ever want to see this company once again.</p>
