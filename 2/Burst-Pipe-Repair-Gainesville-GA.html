<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
