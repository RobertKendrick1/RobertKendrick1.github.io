In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly.

For this reason, the RPZ needs to be installed in locations that are not subject to water damage and allow sufficient drainage.</p>
