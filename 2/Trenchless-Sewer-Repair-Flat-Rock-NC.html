<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Flat Rock NC</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular occurrence, but it does happen more frequently than you think! When you don't see the water was off for a couple of minutes, often it takes place at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a new pipe. This makes building jobs quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire engine use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p>When the data gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has deteriorated in its efficiency below the developed minimum standard, backflow preventers should only be repaired. The test procedure is a diagnostic assessment of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if needed, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This indicates the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
