Like any house appliance, a toilet tank features numerous little moving parts that may need changed with usage over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and cause toilet leakages that aren't clearly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can likewise occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Blending evaporated salt with rock salt is not recommended, as this could clog the softening tank.

In any case, when you're preparing a water heater replacement, play it safe. If you need a permit, call your local department of inspections and ask. And make sure a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
