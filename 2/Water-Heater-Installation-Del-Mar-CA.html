A batch feed waste disposal unit costs more than a continuous-feed disposal but is excellent for putting safety initially. It runs in batches and has a cover over the disposal entrance, requiring that you put the food into the disposal and after that turn a switch to grind the food.

Inspections contacted on work not finished, not correctly installed, or on an inaccessible home will require re-inspection.
