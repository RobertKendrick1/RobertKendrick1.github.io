<p>As discussed previously in the post, carbon monoxide gas is colorless and completely odor free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every house should have carbon monoxide detectors set up at the proper locations. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single houses to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are generally offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new setups need to have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
