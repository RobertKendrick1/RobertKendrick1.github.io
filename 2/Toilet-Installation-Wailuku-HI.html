<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Wailuku HI</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
