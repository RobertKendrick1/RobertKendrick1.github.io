Atmos Energy does not keep the natural gas lines on your property beyond our meter, this is the exact same as other energies, such as your electrical wiring and pipes.

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
