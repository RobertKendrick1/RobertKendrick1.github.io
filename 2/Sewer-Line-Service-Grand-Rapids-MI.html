You can unwind and use your gas piping without any worry when we handle your gas or gas pipe installation and gas pipe repair. While water overuse is a problem for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regeneration process. That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to get rid of the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals carry favorable charges, so water softeners use sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with safe and clean water, you are needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, drinkable and watering, you are also required to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
