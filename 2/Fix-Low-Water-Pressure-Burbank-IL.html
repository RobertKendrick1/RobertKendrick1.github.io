Its sole task is to prevent drinking water from being contaminated due to backflow.</p>

Inspections called in on work not completed, not correctly installed, or on an inaccessible residential or commercial property will require re-inspection. It is the permit holder's obligation to reschedule the inspection and make arrangements for the plumbing inspector to access the property.</p>
