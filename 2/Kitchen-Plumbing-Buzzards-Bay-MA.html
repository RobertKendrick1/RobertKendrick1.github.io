<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Buzzards Bay MA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
