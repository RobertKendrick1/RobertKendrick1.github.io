<p>Professional installers use internal pipe covering to repair an existing sewer pipe that has actually begun to leak into surrounding soil.

<p>During normal operation, the pressure in between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of decreased pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is created to open and release water to the exterior. An RPZ will occasionally release percentages of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ should be installed in locations that are not subject to water damage and allow adequate drainage.</p>
