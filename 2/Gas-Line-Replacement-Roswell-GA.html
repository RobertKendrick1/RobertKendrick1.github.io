<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines. When you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer, a little cylindrical fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank. Lay it aside so you can reattach it to the brand-new line throughout installation. Fewer parts in the system lead to fewer tankless water heater repair consultations.</p>

The most typical washers are typically readily available in your home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be hard to discover. Remove it and take it to the shop to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
