<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner.
