<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the required instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. There is capacity for the infected water to become a health danger if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, in addition to examined every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
