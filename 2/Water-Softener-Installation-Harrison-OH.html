<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is typical in our market and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
