<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately experiences rust and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
