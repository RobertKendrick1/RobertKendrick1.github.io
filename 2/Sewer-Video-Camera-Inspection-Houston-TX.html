<h3>Bathtub Repair in Houston Texas</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
