Repiping a house can take from a couple of hours for a simplistic minor pipe repair or replacement, or it can use up to a week for larger homes requiring the whole plumbing system repiped.

Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material.

Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.

<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Saint Johns FL</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
