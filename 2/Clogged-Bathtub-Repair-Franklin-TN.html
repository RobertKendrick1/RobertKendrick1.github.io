<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains significant quantities of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its lots of intended uses around your house.</p>
<p>Water hardness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Due to the fact that soap reacts with the calcium to form soap scum, the reason you can feel the difference on your skin is. This leads to the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term hardness" originated from ... it's hard to wash in.</p>

After they offered me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, considering that I never wish to see this company once again.</p>
<p>A check backflow preventer features two spring-loaded check assemblies to avoid back and back siphonage pressure on non-health hazard (low hazard) systems.

Tip: Toss a towel on the floor below to catch water that will drain from the line.</p>
