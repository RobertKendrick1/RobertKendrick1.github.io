<h3>Pipe Cleaning in Bowie Maryland</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
