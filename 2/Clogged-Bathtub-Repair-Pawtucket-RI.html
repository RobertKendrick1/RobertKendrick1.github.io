<p>Some plumbers charge more for their services than others, but that's usually an indicator of their quality. Normally speaking, more experienced plumbers will charge more for their services. Tankless water heaters eliminate the long haul for heat of the conventional hot water tank. Plumbing pipes, like everything else, wear out in time. Normally, it is best to replace the pipes when the damage is too comprehensive for repair.
