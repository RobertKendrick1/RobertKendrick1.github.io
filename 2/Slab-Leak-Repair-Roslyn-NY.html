<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Model GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is among the least costly backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and benefit back siphonage only for non-health hazard or health danger conditions. They should be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It should likewise be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can only protect against back siphonage.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that are subject to fouling, wear or tiredness. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be tested periodically to ensure they are functioning effectively. A visual check of air gaps is sufficient, but mechanical backflow preventers need to be evaluated with appropriately calibrated gauge devices.</p>
