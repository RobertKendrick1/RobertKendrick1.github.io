I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
