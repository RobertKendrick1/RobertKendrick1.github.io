<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by constantly bringing tanks off-line and online in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
