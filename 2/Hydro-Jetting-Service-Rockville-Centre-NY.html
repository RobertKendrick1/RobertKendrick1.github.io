<p>Backflow threatens due to the fact that it can contaminate the public drinking supply with pollutants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and damaging chemicals. In 2010, for example, students at a Bowling Green, Kentucky primary school suffered nausea and other symptoms after a contractor working on the HVAC system triggered the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>Backflow Preventers are an essential part of any plumbing project with the function of keeping drinkable water separate from any possible risks through several applications. We offer a range of types of Backflow Preventers, including Minimized Pressure Zone (RPZ) Assemblies, Vacuum Breakers, Double Checks, and Check Valve Assemblies, in addition to accompanying test sets, valves, and enclosures.</p>
