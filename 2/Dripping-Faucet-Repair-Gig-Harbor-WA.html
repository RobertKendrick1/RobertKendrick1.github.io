<p>When the information gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has degraded in its efficiency listed below the established minimum basic, backflow preventers need to only be fixed. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if needed, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working requirements. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
