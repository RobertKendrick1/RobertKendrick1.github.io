<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Pawleys Island SC?</h3>
<p>Aside from water dripping and the occasional creak, your pipes must not be making any odd noises, specifically not ones loud enough to keep you up during the night. If your pipes are rattling, clanking, banging or making other obnoxious sounds, that's a guaranteed indication of a bigger problem. Have your pipes checked as soon as possible so you do not end up with a significant leak.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you may have to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug set that I bought separately from the disposal system. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Having your plumbing repiped can save you money and time in addition to secure your health in the future. After softening a large amount of hard water, the exchange medium becomes covered with calcium and magnesium ions. When this takes place, the exchange medium should be recharged or regrowed (Figure 1).
