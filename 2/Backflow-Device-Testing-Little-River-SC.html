<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Little River SC</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular event, but it does happen more frequently than you think! When you don't discover the water was off for a couple of minutes, often it happens at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to restore and go into the valve pressure equivalent to ambient climatic standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
