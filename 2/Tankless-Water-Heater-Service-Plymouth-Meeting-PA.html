After they offered me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, because I never ever wish to see this company again.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the offender. But not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can cause problem too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
