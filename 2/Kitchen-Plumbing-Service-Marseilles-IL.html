<p>Backpressure might take place when the potable supply piping is linked to a system or component which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not effectively protected, potable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system.</p>
<p>In many cases, a lack of warm water is triggered by a defective breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. If the water is lukewarm, the dip tube inside the tank might be split. Scalding water is typically the result of a broken pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water threatens and must be instantly attended to by a skilled plumbing professional.</p>
