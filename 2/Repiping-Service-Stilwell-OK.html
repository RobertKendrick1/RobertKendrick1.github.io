<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is normal in our industry and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
