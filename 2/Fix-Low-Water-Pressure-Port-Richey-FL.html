<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc developed and built a smaller sized design that operated on the exact same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise built a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can take place when there is an unexpected reduction in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as throughout fire fighting or when a water main breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This reversal can develop a suction effect and draw possible pollutants into the potable (drinking) water supply. Tank water heaters are typically found in the majority of homes. Their parts are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water till it's needed. A pipe emerges from the top to deliver hot water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
