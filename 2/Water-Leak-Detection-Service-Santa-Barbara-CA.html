The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century.
