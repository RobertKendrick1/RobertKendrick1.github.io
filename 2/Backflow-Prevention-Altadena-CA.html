<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, however how do they work and which designs are best for particular applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are defined by local statutes and environmental guidelines. Local building codes for example will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap in between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any prospective siphon prior to it can take place, preventing infecting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more complicated and advanced backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets installed to prevent backflow range from the fairly simple to the complex and very sophisticated.</p>
