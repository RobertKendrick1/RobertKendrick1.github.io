<h3>Water Softeners & Filters in Camden South Carolina</h2>
<p>Every day you count on your water heater more than you may even realize.

You will wish to install the softener in a dry, level area, like a basement or garage. It will need to be near to the water's main line, an electrical outlet to turn on the system, and a drain for the brine service from the regrowth cycle.</p>
