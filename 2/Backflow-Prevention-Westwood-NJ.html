<p>When a garbage disposal breaks, it is probably only a matter of time prior to your sink begins to clog, as you and other house members are probably not used to making sure that no obstructive food waste goes down your drain. Those dissolved solids can cause a flaky accumulation on everything from meals, to pipes, to the heating components of your devices, to your own body. Soap scum and clogged, rusty plumbing are normally the outcome of tough water.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this technique, you know the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
