<p>Won't drain - The unit may not be chopping food properly and waste might have clogged the drain pipe. However, if there are several leaks within the system, or if there is proof of rust in several locations, it is probably time to repipe. A water softener is loaded with resin beads. Difficult water with calcium and magnesium flows through this resin and, in a procedure called ion exchange, the hardness ions in the water trade places with soft ions on the resin beads.

Lots of insurer will not cover a sluggish leak. Claims might be denied because the standard HO-3 homeowners' policy particularly omits "a loss as the result of a water leak over a prolonged time period." Call your insurance representative and validate your coverage. Once you have read through your policy and validated what is covered and what is not covered, check with your agent to validate that your understanding is appropriate.</p>
