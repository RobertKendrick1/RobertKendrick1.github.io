<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; extra, more significant costs can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for citizens. A PE or RA can help determine if installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>
