If you reside in a structure that is around 50 years old, there is a good chance that your pipes were made with galvanized metal which is more likely to burst as it ages. As soon as your house starts to approach this age, you must begin getting more regular inspections and maintenance examine your plumbing to ensure you do not have any leaks or damage developing in your house.</p>

<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

The metal pipes are galvanized steel or brass, copper, and iron. The plastic pipes are Poly Vinyl Chloride PVC, Chlorine Poly Vinyl Chloride CPVC, Poly Ethylene PE, Polybutylene PB, and Kitec. The majority of these plastic pipe systems will end in suits. Part of the problem is with the fittings that are frequently cheaply made with little quality control by a verity of overseas companies. Plastic pipes also have questionable joining approaches. Plastic pipes are glued, crimped, and banded. When plastic pipes blow a joint they blow apart and lead to water damage.
