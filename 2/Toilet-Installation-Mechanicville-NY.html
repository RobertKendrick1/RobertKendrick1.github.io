<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts need to be eliminated and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. It is important that only initial factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to utilize and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>The simplest option may seem to be merely neglecting the issue or utilizing a do it yourself chemical solution. However, this is a short-term fix and might trigger more damage.
