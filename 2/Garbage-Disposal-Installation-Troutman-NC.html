<h3>Water Heater Leaking in Troutman NC? How to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>Older plumbing systems may have pipes that rust with time, resulting in leakages or other problems. Additionally, rust or other buildups in the pipes can limit air flow and make it difficult to use one or more of your gas-powered appliances like the clothes dryer or stove. Based upon research conducted by the Water Quality Association (WQA) Water Softener Benefits Study, 2011.</p>
<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mostly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening just gets rid of firmness minerals and removes problems that are an annoyance and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a considerable one.</p>

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and identify the cause of the problem. The line was plainly degrading; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
