When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

<p>A lot of homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition security. As the outer coating of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
