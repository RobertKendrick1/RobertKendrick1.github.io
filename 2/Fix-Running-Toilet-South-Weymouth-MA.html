<p>What is tough water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains considerable amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a problem-- for its lots of designated usages around your home.</p>
<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of significant surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with regularly.
