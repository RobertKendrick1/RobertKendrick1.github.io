<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
