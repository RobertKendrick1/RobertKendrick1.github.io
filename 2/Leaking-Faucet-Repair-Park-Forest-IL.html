<p>In some cases called an auger, this handy tool can clear clogs that may be stuck even more down the system. You'll need to take apart the drainpipe and P-trap that runs below the kitchen sink to expose the stub pipe" or stubout" that travels behind the cabinet wall. This is where you place the snake into the pipe until you feel resistance to break up the clog.</p>
<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of worn thin pipe and the painting the within the used pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes.
