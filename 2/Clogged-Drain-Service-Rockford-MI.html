Natural gas tank systems use nearly 50% less energy, costing less to run, than the electric variety. Nevertheless, they cost a bit more than electrical designs.

We offer gas hot water heater service, along with electric water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Coast.</p>

Here's how it works: During regular operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves-- referred to as the zone of lowered pressure-- is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is designed to discharge and open water to the outside, guaranteeing backflow never ever takes place.</p>
