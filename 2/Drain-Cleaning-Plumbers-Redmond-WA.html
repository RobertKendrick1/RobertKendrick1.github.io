<p>The average life expectancy of an electrical water heater is more than that of a gas one. Unseen sets of pipes utilize pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a separate drain path, small pipes range from the tub and sink to ultimately meet a bigger one beneath the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the house.</p>
<p>The Final Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that regulates water circulation in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that ranges from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't installed properly, you may experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in wasted water.</p>
