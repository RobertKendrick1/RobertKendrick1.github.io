<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system needs to be constantly monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>The Battelle Research study also found tough water to quickly result in clogged shower heads, in some cases after as little as a year and a half of routine use. After simply one week of constant testing with difficult water, more than three-fourths of shower head nozzles ended up being clogged, according to laboratory results. Shower heads using water dealt with by a water softening system, on the other hand, performed nearly as well as on the day they were set up.</p>
<p>In some cases you know you have a sewer line break because you can smell foul smells or you have a sewage back-up in your home.

Often times the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can save you countless dollars in repairs. Merely sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can fix the issue. The specialists and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you always have a copy for your insurance coverage realtor, city or company inspector.</p>
