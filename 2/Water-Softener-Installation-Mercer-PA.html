<p>Backpressure is produced when pressure in a water supply exceeds the pressure in the potable system offering the make-up water. This can require the drinkable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Possible pollutants can then get in the drinkable water system. The best method to decrease build-up is have a professional flush it at least when a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral content, you might need to flush the hot water heater more frequently.</p>
