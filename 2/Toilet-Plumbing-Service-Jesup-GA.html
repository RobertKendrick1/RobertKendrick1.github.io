<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Jesup GA</h3>

<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were prompt and really responsive to send me a quote which was really competitive. They were very professional and did an amazing task. I would definitely call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration just appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust most likely exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still a problem that needs to be dealt with right now (you'll likely need a brand-new hot water heater) but not one that requires repiping.</p>
