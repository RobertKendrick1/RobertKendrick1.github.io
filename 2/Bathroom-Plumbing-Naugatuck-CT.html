<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
