<h3>Need An Emergency Plumber Indian Head MD</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities needs that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be needed to be located on the water service line, within the structure, or both areas. After a preliminary inspection and testing of a freshly installed backflow preventer, the water client is required to have the backflow preventer tested on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>There are a number of indications to keep an eye out for. 1) The surface area of the floor in one area is warm or perhaps hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all devices and fixtures in your house have been turned off. 3) The water heater appears to be running all the time. 4) All this adds up to greater gas and water bills, in some cases very quickly.</p>
