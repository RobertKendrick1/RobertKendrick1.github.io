Larry & Sons uses detailed sewer line and drain installation for basic drainage in municipal water products, septic tanks for those not connected to a city sewer system, and drain tile systems for basement water elimination Our expert professionals thoroughly install new drainage pipes and systems, and hand select components that match your system's specific requirements.</p>
<p>When the water softening does not occur it could also show softener malfunction, or an issue with the salt that is used. At home stores, a lot of Badger 5 disposals can be purchased for about $99-150. With Bill Howe's additional warranty, with installation, customers are looking at approximately $325. The Evolution Series and other high horse power sturdy disposals with peaceful functions typically start at $300 and up just for the disposal.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might need to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug package that I bought separately from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
