<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has space to hold on to favorable ions. The fresh media begins by holding on to the weaker charged salt ions. As difficult water goes through your water softener tank, the more powerful charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Considering that the solidity minerals have a higher positive charge than the sodium, they will knock the salt ions off and take their place.</p>
<p>Place the epoxy on the gas line. It is very important to follow the application procedure detailed in the plan. Leave it in, preferably over night, for it to cure and hold strongly. When treated, tighten the fittings on the high-pressure gas line. Its time now to re-install the low-pressure gas line when this is done.
