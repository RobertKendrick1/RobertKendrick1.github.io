<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean.

When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately begins. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regeneration normally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
