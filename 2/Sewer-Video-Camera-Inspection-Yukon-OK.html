An authorization is not required for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages supplied alterations are not made in the existing piping or components. A normal water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, large brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a neighboring drain or drywell.</p>
<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to remove the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and lots of other minerals bring positive charges, so water softeners use sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you water with potable water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, drinkable and irrigation, you are also needed to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
