<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Norcross GA</h3>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Unfortunately, main line blockages are not something a house owner can fix. This type of clog needs a professional plumber or drain service technician to utilize a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can make use of a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this kind of camera to recognize and repair the drain issue. This kind of camera is specifically helpful in finding a problem if you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This activates the disc to open, enabling air to enter the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
