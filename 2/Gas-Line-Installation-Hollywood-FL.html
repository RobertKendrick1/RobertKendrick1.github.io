Collect your household and move them out, then call to signal the gas company what has actually taken place. Next, call your local plumbing expert so they can come, examine the line, and see if repair or replacement is required. A reputable company like Gene Johnson Plumbing & Heating can supply gas line installation to replace the broken pipe.</p>
<p>Many disposals will last between 10 and 12 years before requiring replacement. Signs that your disposal needs to be replaced include needing to push the reset button regularly, the blades no longer chopping up the waste well or taking longer to chop up the waste, leaking from the bottom of the system, frequent clogs, or noticeable rust on the system itself.</p>
