<p>During normal operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of reduced pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is developed to open and discharge water to the exterior. An RPZ will periodically release small amounts of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ should be installed in locations that are exempt to water damage and permit sufficient drainage.</p>

<p>In community supply of water systems, water is usually preserved at a significant pressure to enable water to flow to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your home or service. When the pressure drops for some reason such as may happen when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to fight a fire or a water main breaks or some other circumstance happens, infected water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an occurrence, there needs to be some kind of backflow prevention method used. The best and safest type of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the component). The proper backflow prevention device is required if an air space is not possible. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is managed by the Ohio Epa and your water supplier.</p>
