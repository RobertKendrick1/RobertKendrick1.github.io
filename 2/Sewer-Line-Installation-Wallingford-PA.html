<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
