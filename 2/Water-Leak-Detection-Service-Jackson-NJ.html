When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. There is capacity for the contaminated water to become a health hazard if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, in addition to checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
