<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe at Millersville PA</h3>
<p>If you have a toilet issue, we have a plumbing service. Since 1992, our toilet repair and installation specialists have served the communities of Palmdale, Lancaster, and the surrounding locations and constructed long lasting relationships with customers based on remarkable client service. We have decades of experience in installing and repairing toilets, and we  want to remain for another couple of decades helping people like you and your household.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
