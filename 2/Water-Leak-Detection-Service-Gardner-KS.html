<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede versus the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. If enabled to return to the supply of water, there is potential for the infected water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for effectiveness, as well as examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
