<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Forest Park GA</h3>
<p>We truly care about our consumers and the services that we offer. As tough water passes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with salt ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are replaced easily by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this process, free" salt ions are released into the water. The time between recharging cycles depends on the hardness of the water, the quantity of water used, the size of the unit and the capability of the exchange media to get rid of solidity.</p>
<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the within the used pipe with epoxy paint. Often throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin spots leak right away and in some cases those leaks come weeks or days later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be correctly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
