After we have cleaned the body, and the fixed components are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or particles. This can be tricky, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system needs to be made use of to assure the line is effectively flushed.</p>

However, if you do have a cross connection to a sprinkler system system, boiler, swimming pool, water function or other type of cross connection, have actually an authorized backflow prevention assembly installed.</p>
