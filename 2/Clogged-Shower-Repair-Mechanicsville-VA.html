<h3>Why Plumbers Are So Expensive Mechanicsville VA</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
