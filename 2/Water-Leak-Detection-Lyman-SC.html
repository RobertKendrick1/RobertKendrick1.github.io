Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions.

The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
