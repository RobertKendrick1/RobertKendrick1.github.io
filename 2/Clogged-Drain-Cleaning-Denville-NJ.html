<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is typical in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
